# An optional EDS course website template

Many MEDS instructors opt to organize their course materials on custom course websites. Increasingly, those websites are built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). You may consider using this template as a way to quick-start your course website development. I encourage you to check out other existing course websites for inspiration as well.

|   Course # | Course title                                                   | Instructor(s)                          | Website URL                                            |

## Using this template

To create a website using this template:

1. Click on the green **Use this template** button (top right)
2. Fill out the necessary fields on the **Create a new repository** page. I recommend naming your new repository following this convention: `EDS-XXX-short-title`. You should also ensure that your repo is **public**. You may choose the owner as your own personal account *or* a GitHub organization that you own.
3. Click **Create repository**

## Getting started with Quarto

If you're new to Quarto, or if this is you're first time building a Quarto website, I recommend that you first check out the following tutorials. These materials should provide some helpful context, as well as step-by-step instructions on building, deploying, and customizing a Quarto website:

- [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)
- [Customizing Quarto Websites Using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide)

The [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) is also an incredibly thorough and helpful resource!

## Wikis coming soon!
